The command for invite is:
/invite <client ID> <session ID>
After receiving a invitation, the client can press "y" or "n" to accept or reject the invitation. 
We implemented invite by sending a message to the invited client from the server. If the client responds "y", then send a package back to the server. 
The server will then add this client to the session specified by the inviter. 

To leave one session, specify its session ID. The formate for this command is: 
/leavesession <session ID>

We have also allowed client to leave all sessions using the command "leaveallsesssions". The format for this command is: 
/leaveallsessions

When sending message, client needs to specify a session ID first. The format for sending messages is:
 <session ID>: <message>
Only the message part is forwarded to other clients in the specified session. 
The server separates session ID from the rest of the message using the delimiter ": ".
